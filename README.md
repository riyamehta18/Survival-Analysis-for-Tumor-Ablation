# Overview
This repository contains the code for a data analysis and statistical modeling project focused on tumor recurrence and mortality after Simulation-Guided Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA). The analysis involves the use of survival analysis, competing risk regression, and Cox mixed-effects models to understand factors influencing local recurrence, hepatic recurrence, and overall survival. The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of Simulation-Guided RFA in preventing tumor recurrence and improving patient outcomes.

# Key Features
Data Processing: The project involves reading and processing data from multiple CSV files.
Survival Analysis: Kaplan-Meier survival curves and cumulative incidence functions are utilized to analyze time-to-event data.
Competing Risk Regression: Competing risk regression models are employed to assess factors influencing local recurrence and hepatic recurrence.
Mixed-Effects Models: Cox mixed-effects models are fitted to explore the impact of various covariates on recurrence and mortality.
Sample Size Calculation: The repository also includes code for sample size calculation based on historical control rates and desired improvements.
